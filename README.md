# RandonOS

This repo is arcived. Too many issus with uefi system not working. Interrupts don't work correctly, or at all on real hardware. Just use gcc to just compile linux applications and the linux kernel only. I will be making a new OS from a different series. I will use ThatOSDev's OS series.

Please support him on youtube.

This is an OS that I am making as a hobby. I wanted it to be a little random. I'm using the How to make an OS series by Poncho on Youtube.
